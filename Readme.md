	CREDITS + ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:



We had a lot of help in making this project happen. 
Thanks to CBS, Stephen Colbert, Donald Trump, and everyone at "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" for the idea behind the project. 

We also made use of Princeton's many amenities, including reimbusements, food, mentors, workshops, workspace, network, etc. 

Software used included Sublime Text 2, Sublime Text 3, Google Chrome, and Adobe Illustrator. 

We also used several resources available online:
Trump "You're Fired!" sounds were acquired through episodes of The Apprentice, avilable on Youtube.

Other Trump sounds were accessed through the independent journal review, accessible here: http://trumpsoundboard.com/
